          <p>It is my pleasure to present the Public Policy Center’s Annual Report for academic year 2018-19. All of the work we do is in the name of creating new knowledge about issues that advance the public good and sharing this information with policymakers and the public. At the same time, the Public Policy Center (PPC) contributes to student success by employing and training students in research related activities, and supports interdisciplinary research activities on campus. This report highlights some of the accomplishments of our team at the Public Policy Center this past year. I hope you’ll take some time to look through the report and explore the great work of folks associated with the Center.</p>
          <p>In fulfilling our mission of being in the UI Central Administration as part of the Office of the Vice President for Research, we had the pleasure of working with colleagues in over 50 units on campus. These collaborations involved the conduct of interdisciplinary research; the sharing of research through engagement activities; and grant development, data collection and methods workshops through our Iowa Social Science Research Center.</p>
          <p>To fulfill our community engagement mission, the PPC hosted lectures, workshops, symposiums, and a film screening. Tamara Keith of National Public Radio participated in a dialogue about “The Future of US Politics: Looking Ahead to 2020,” on the stage of the Englert Theatre, along with Chris Buskirk of <em>American Greatness</em>, and Melissa Ryan of <em>Ctrl Alt-Right Delete</em>. We co-sponsored several events with other campus colleagues, including lectures by Cokie Roberts (College of Law) and US Senator (NE) Ben Sasse (UI Lecture Committee), the Provost’s Global Forum – “Why School? International Perspectives on Education and Social Transformation,” the ISRC’s Data Science Institute, and an open forum, “A House Divided: What’s Wrong with Our Politics?” with Kirkwood Community College.</p> 
          <p>2018-19 was also the PPC’s 30th anniversary year. In celebration, we hosted “Visualizing Equitable and Sustainable Communities in Iowa,” which highlighted the work of our various research programs in a fun, fast-paced, “3-minute thesis” format, along with poster presentations.</p>
          <p>It is exciting to think of how much the Center has grown and how integrated the PPC’s activities are all across campus. This cross-fertilization from interdisciplinary activities is what makes the Public Policy Center such a vibrant and fulfilling hub on campus.</p>
          <p>I feel privileged to lead the Center’s dedicated staff and faculty and am grateful for all their hard work and creativity that leads to our success in generating new knowledge and sharing it with the campus and beyond. On behalf of all of us, thank you for your support, and we look forward to working with you in 2018-19.</p>

            <p>In July of 2017, the Public Policy Center added a sixth policy program – the Crime and Justice Policy Research Program (CJPRP) - to continue its mission towards providing policy makers and the public with research that helps our communities thrive. <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/mark-berg" target="_blank">Dr. Mark Berg</a>, associate professor in the Department of Sociology in the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, was appointed director of the CJPRP. Berg has extensive training in crime and justice policy and his research interests primarily include interpersonal violence, social determinants of health and the social context of adolescent development. He teaches graduate and undergraduate courses on criminology, communities, and interpersonal violence.</p>
            <p><a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/ethan-rogers" target="_blank">Ethan Rogers</a> was hired as a research coordinator in the CJPRP to facilitate and conduct national and local policy research on crime and justice. In the past year, Rogers’ research has focused on criminal justice processing, the escalation of violence in interpersonal conflicts, and the mobilization of the law. Research in the CJPRP is also supported by faculty with joint appointments in other academic departments as well as graduate and undergraduate students.</p>

            <p>In the Fall of 2017, staff with the CJPRP began assisting the Marion Police Department in their efforts to reduce crime and improve policing strategies. In addition to helping the department establish the foundation for an in-house criminal analyst, the CJPRP researchers used calls for service data and Geographic Information Systems techniques to revise their patrol structure. The goal of the revised beat structure was to be more responsive to community needs and to reduce response times. They presented their recommendations to the Marion City Council in March of 2018.</p>
            <p><a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/mark-berg" target="_blank">Mark Berg</a> and <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/ethan-rogers" target="_blank">Ethan Rogers</a> presented a preliminary report in December 2017 to the Johnson County Board of Supervisors and the Johnson County Attorney’s Office assessing the demographic profile of case processing and sentencing in the Johnson County courts. The preliminary evaluation revealed group disparities in various stages of the cases processed in Johnson County; however, it also revealed a need for additional data collection, including information on access to counsel and criminal histories. Data collection is ongoing.</p>

            <p><a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/sara-b-mitchell" target="_blank">Sara Mitchell</a>, professor in the Department of Political Science in the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, published an article in <em>Political Analysis</em> about the gender gap in citation patterns in the social sciences.  She finds significant gender gaps in academic citations, where women are more likely than men to cite other women authors and women authors’ work is seen as less central to the field.  She also published an article entitled, “Bones of Democratic Contention: Maritime Disputes,” that explains why Democratic countries, although less likely to go to war, do enter disputes over fishing and oil resources with regularity.  Her coauthor on this piece is Kelly Daniels, a former undergraduate student at the University of Iowa.</p>

The award honors excellence in teaching and design of learning experiences that are accessible, engaging, and effective for all students, and includes a $10,000 prize for each winner.</p>
            <p>Nguyen-Hoang’s course, Financing Local Government, was submitted for consideration. The graduate-level course is offered in the spring semester in the UI School of Urban and Regional Planning, which he began teaching in 2011. The overall goal of the course is to help students possess knowledge and skills in local budgeting processes, mechanics of various revenue sources for local governments, and especially the connection between these revenue sources and land use as well as other fields of planning.</p>
            <p>The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy has four areas of focus in its Mission: Land Value Capture and Property Tax, Municipal Fiscal Health, Informality and Urban Poverty, and Climate Change. The former two focus areas are covered in depth in Financing Local Government. Select units of the course and its innovative elements will be highlighted on the Lincoln Institute's online course platform.</p>

            <p>Carney and Reyes conducted a study that placed video recorders into teen’s vehicles. The recorded data informed the modified graduated driver licensing system in Iowa, which added restrictions on teen drivers, including passenger limits, nighttime driving limits, and cell phone restrictions, all helping to reduce teen driver injuries and death.</p>

            <h4>TraumaHawk Now in Fourth Phase of Development</h4>
            <p>TraumaHawk, a smartphone app for law enforcement designed to connect first responders to hospital trauma teams, completed its fourth phase of development this year. The app allows first responders to generate and send a report with vital collision information, including photographs showing the extent of intrusion and damage in a vehicle’s occupant compartment, to the receiving trauma center. These reports provide trauma teams with significantly more time and information to prepare for incoming patients than the conventional ambulance crew notification.</p>
            <p>This critical additional time allows trauma staff to assemble a more complete and appropriate level of treatment by specialists, as well as to arrange other vital aspects of care, such as scheduling operating rooms.</p>
            <p>Phase IV upgraded the TraumaHawk server, increased the geographical area with Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines, and integrated Central Iowa law enforcement.</p>
            <p>Prinicipal Investigators on the TraumaHawk project are <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/daniel-mcgehee" target="_blank">Dan McGehee</a>, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/christopher-buresh" target="_blank">Christopher Buresh</a>, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/michelle-reyes" target="_blank">Cherie Roe</a>.</p>

          <p><a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/frederick-boehmke" target="_blank">Fred Boehmke</a> participated in two Digital Bridges Summer Collaborative Grants with faculty from UI and Grinnell College.</p>
          <p>“The Text Analysis Group” focused on pedagogical applications of text analysis using statistical methods over the course of summer 2017. The collaborators included Erik Simpson (English) and Pamela Fellers (Statistics) from Grinnell, and Paul Dilley (Classics) from Iowa.</p>
          <p>Boehmke and Dilley team-taught a fall Big Ideas course titled, “Information, Society, and Culture,” using the Text Analysis Group to explore academic and popular literature related to text analysis (e.g., <em>Nabokov’s Favorite Word is Mauve</em>), as well as appropriate tools to allow students in introductory (Voyant) or advanced (Python) courses to analyze and model text as data. They discussed ways to get students engaged with the text, including the possibility of using established authors, social media, popular contemporary books, or students’ own writing samples. </p>
          <p>The second collaboration was with Timothy Dobe (Religious Studies, Grinnell), called “Building Movements for Social and Religious Change.”</p>

          <h4>ISRC Awards Seven CPRDC Seed Grants</h4>
          <p>The ISRC, in cooperation with the Public Policy Center and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln (UNL), awarded seven seed grants that provide funding for researchers to develop a full research protocol that provides access to the restricted-use microdata available through the <a href="https://business.unl.edu/outreach/central-plains-federal-statistical-research-data-center/about/" target="_blank">Central Plains Research Data Center (CPRDC)</a> housed at UNL. The University of Iowa is a member of the CPRDC consortium.</p>
          <p>Among the grant awardees were PPC researchers: <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/natoshia-askelson" target="_blank">Natoshia Askelson</a>, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/susan-mckernan" target="_blank">Susan McKernan</a>, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/phuong-nguyen" target="_blank">Phuong Nguyen-Hoang</a>, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/haifeng-qian" target="_blank">Haifeng Qian</a>, and <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/aparna-shivanand-ingleshwar" target="_blank">Aparna Ingleshwar</a>.</p>
          <p>The CPRDC seed grants may be used in a variety of ways, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hire a student (e.g. undergraduate or graduate, biweekly or part of GA appointment) to assist in background research and proposal preparation.</li>
            <li>Salary support for the researcher to perform activities related to proposal preparation.</li>
            <li>Purchase data necessary to merge with CPRDC data, e.g., in order to combine existing data with lower-level geographic data available through the CPRDC one might need to purchase geographic identifiers not publicly available.</li>

The center also supported the class Big Ideas: Equality, Opportunity, and Public Policy in America, an undergraduate course focused on the policy challenges posed by the search for economic security and equality of opportunity.  Each topical unit concluded with a public forum, bringing together the campus and local community to discuss major social issues facing us today.</p>

          <p>In fulfilling our community engagement mission, the PPC hosted fourteen Forkenbrock Series events, which included the undergraduate “Big Ideas” course, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/forkenbrock/policy-matters-2017" target="_blank">Equality, Opportunity, and Public Policy in America</a> series. The Forkenbrock Series features guest speakers and symposiums, and provides a forum for dialogue about policy areas from applied, academic, and interdisciplinary perspectives. The series was formed in honor of David Forkenbrock, who established the PPC at the University of Iowa in 1987.</p>
          <p>We co-sponsored 13 events with other departments, including Ellen Stofan’s lecture, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/events/climate-change-keeping-earth-green-clean-and-habitable" target="_blank">“Climate Change: Keeping the Earth Green, Clean, and Habitable,”</a> and fundraising events for the UI Veterans Association and Crisis Center of Johnson County. We collaborated with the University of Iowa Environmental Health Sciences Research Center, UI Center for Health Effects of Environmental Contamination, and the UI Center for Global and Regional Environmental Research on the symposium, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/events/challenges-providing-safe-drinking-water-midwest-symposium" target="_blank">“Challenges to Providing Safe Drinking Water in the Midwest.”</a> For the first time, the PPC co-sponsored the Iowa City Foreign Relations Council’s  noon luncheon series, which features speakers from around the world.</p>

        <p>In celebration of Earth Week, the PPC hosted a <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/forkenbrock/world-climate" target="_blank">World Climate Simulation</a> at the Iowa City Public Library. In a mock UN negotiation, participants, assigned to six different delegations (United States, European Union, Other Developed Nations, China, India, and Other Developing Nations), pledged policy changes aimed toward meeting the Paris Agreement goal: to reduce carbon emissions and prevent ocean temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius. The simulation was led by <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/jonathan-carlson" target="_blank">Jon Carlson</a> and <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/david-cwiertny" target="_blank">David Cwiertny</a>, of the Environmental Policy Research Program.</p>
        <p>Using a C-ROADS climate simulation model, the pledges were entered into the program for instant results. The group failed to meet the goal after the first round of negotiations, although they came close at 2.7 degrees.</p>
        <p>A second round of negotiations revealed the complex and interesting socioeconomic dynamics among the delegations, with the developing nations revealing that they felt ignored by the more powerful delegations. Feeling a distrust in the pledges the US and EU had made, they withdrew some of their own commitments. A “planted” fuel fossil lobbyist (Silvia Secchi, Environmental Policy Research Program) added to the difficulty of the negotiations.</p>
        <p>Though the group ultimately failed to reach the 2°C goal, they felt it was a valuable learning exercise, and left with a better understanding of the complexities of the issue.</p>

        <p>On Monday, October 9th, about 120 guests gathered for a <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/forkenbrock/gendered-violence" target="_blank">Conference on Gendered Violence</a>.</p>
        <p>The event started with a welcome and some solemn remarks from Beth Krayenhagen, who was a victim of sexual assault as a student at the University of Iowa. It was the first time she had shared the story of her assault publicly.</p>
        <p>Brad Kunkel, a sergeant with the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office, and co-chair of the Domestic Violence Intervention Program’s board of directors, spoke next about the domestic violence his family experienced during his childhood, and about his sister, who was killed in a domestic violence incident.</p>
        <p>The panelists examined the topic from local/state, national and international perspectives, touching on their own research and experiences.  For more details about the panel discussions, see the Politics and Policy Research program section of this report.</p>
        <p>Sarah Super, a rape survivor, educator, and activist, gave the keynote speech. Super described her rape, and talked about a “trauma-sensitive” approach to the care of sexual assault victims. Break the Silence, an organization founded by Super, offers victims an outlet for telling their own stories and to organize public protests or demonstrations.</p>
        <p>Included in the event was a gallery of work related to domestic violence, by local artists Melissa Kreider, Jessica Pleyel, and Rachel Williams.</p>

    <p>On October 9, 2017, the PPC’s Politics and Policy Research Program hosted the <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/forkenbrock/gendered-violence" target="_blank">Conference on Gendered Violence</a>, a day-long event focusing on international, national, and state and local problems concerning domestic and sexual violence policy.  The conference brought together practitioners and researchers to learn from each other and discuss problems and possible solutions.</p>
    <p>One highlight of the conference was the keynote presentation by Sarah Super.  Super, a rape survivor and activist, described her experience with the legal system and the psychological ramifications of trauma.  Her organization, Break the Silence, engages in community truth-telling events, demonstrations, and remembrances.  Recently, they gained approval from the Minneapolis Park Board to build the nation’s first permanent memorial to honor survivors in the Twin Cities.  The conference also featured art installations by Melissa Kreider, Jessica Pleyel, and Rachel Williams from the University of Iowa.</p>
    <p>Presenters at the conference brought a diverse set of experiences and knowledge.  Michele Leiby from the College of Wooster presented her analysis of sexual abuse of political prisoners in Peru.  Carolyn Hartley of the School of Social Work at the University of Iowa discussed her work on civil legal remedies for domestic violence survivors in the U.S.  Iowa State Representative Mary Mascher and Kristie Doser, head of the Domestic Violence Intervention Program in Iowa City, focused on state and local challenges for domestic violence funding and policy change.</p>

    <p>In May of 2018, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/rebecca-kreitzer" target="_blank">Rebecca Kreitzer</a>, Department of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/tracy-osborn" target="_blank">Tracy Osborn</a> of the University of Iowa political science department, participated for a second year in the PPC’s Summer Scholar Program.  They focused on their ongoing project about women’s representation in state legislatures.  Their question is simple: can organizations focused on recruiting women to run for office improve the number of women in the U.S. state legislatures?  Even though there are nearly 600 of these organizations, little to no research exists that evaluates the success of these organizations as a policy strategy to increase women’s representation.</p>
    <p>During the summer scholar program in 2018, Kreitzer and Osborn finished a number of tasks on their project.  Most important, they executed a survey of each women’s recruitment organization in the U.S.  The online survey asks groups to evaluate their success, their funding, the kinds of women they recruit, and their tactics to train candidates for success.  Jenna Pokorny, a University of Iowa undergraduate in the Department of Political Science, assisted with the execution of the survey.</p>
    <p>Kreitzer and Osborn also finished two publications from the initial census of groups they completed in the 2017 Summer Scholar Program.  The first publication, “Women’s Recruiting Groups in the U.S.,” will appear in <em>Politics, Groups and Identities</em> as part of a symposium on women’s recruiting groups.  The second piece, “Recruitment and Training Organizations for Women as Candidates,” will be part of a new edited book, <em>Good Reasons to Run: Women and Candidacy</em>, from Temple University Press.</p>
    <p>The authors will present the first analysis of the new survey at the 2018 meeting of the American Political Science Association in Boston, MA, in September 2018.  Eventually, along with interviews with groups and legislators, they will turn the entire project into a book about women’s recruitment organizations.</p>

    <p>The PPC and the Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD) have received a $400,000 grant from the Spencer Foundation’s Research-Practice Partnership Program to support the Equity Implemented Partnership led by <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/sarah-bruch" target="_blank">Sarah Bruch</a>, Director of the Social and Education Policy Research Program at the PPC, in coordination with Kingsley Botchway, Director of Equity and Engagement at the ICCSD.</p>
    <p>The Equity Implemented Partnership leverages social science and education policy research and practitioner knowledge to more effectively address persistent problems of policy and practice and improve students’ educational opportunities and outcomes. The broad aim of this research partnership is to improve the equitability of school experiences for students in our school district by providing research expertise and capacity to conduct data collection and analysis, and to project, implement, and design research-based solutions to existing disparities. Over the past two years, the Partnership has created a strong structure and process for collaboration, created trusting relationships, institutionalized multiple data collection instruments, and begun evaluating equity programming initiatives in the District.</p>
    <p>“The partnership benefits the District by giving it the capacity to assess and address its needs,” Bruch said, “but it also benefits the University, by giving faculty and students the invaluable experience of working with community partners on real world issues of pressing concern.”</p>
    <p>The grant will be used to build on this foundation to enhance the role of the Partnership in the District, to engage in collaborative research that furthers knowledge on student experiences of school climate, and to build ICCSD capacity. The funding will strengthen research efforts to investigate the connection between student experiences and outcomes, and to examine the link between racial disparities in student experiences and outcomes. The funding will allow the Partnership to use a district-based liaison who will coordinate and enhance the District’s efforts at addressing equity, and use a school-based strategy working directly with teachers to connect school goals and practices with school-specific data on student achievement and experience disparities.</p>

    <p>Knowing the dynamics of conflict escalation has important implications of understanding individual-differences in interpersonal violence and can inform interventions designed to reduce retaliatory actions, and has been a core research interest for the Crime and Justice Policy Research program.</p>
    <p>In the past year, <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/mark-berg" target="_blank">Mark Berg</a> and <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/ethan-rogers" target="_blank">Ethan Rogers</a> have worked on interpersonal conflict research through the support of two national grants funded by the National Institute of Justice. The first project, <em>“Situational Factors and the Victim-Offender Overlap,”</em> gathered original data on a sample of inmates and their contacts in the community on the situational dynamics of their interpersonal conflicts. The second project, the <em>“Interpersonal Conflict and Resolution (iCOR) Study,”</em> was designed through a partnership with NORC at the University of Chicago. This 31-month project collected data on the frequency and nature of conflicts from a nationally-representative sample of young adults and their intimate partners. Here are just a few research questions that have been addressed from these projects:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Why are offenders and victims often the same people?</em> Berg and Rogers, along with co-authors from Penn State, explored potential explanations for the strong association between offending and victimization – known as the offender-victim overlap. Their results revealed that the overlap may be in part due to the tendency to become involved in verbal conflicts. Verbal disputes create opportunities for violence and, as a result, individuals with greater tendencies for verbal conflict are more likely to become either offenders or victims. This study was published in the Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency.</li>
      <li><em>What accounts for the link between affective impairment and interpersonal violence?</em> From the iCOR study, Berg, Rogers, and colleagues investigated the mechanisms through which adverse mental health states increase physical aggression. The findings suggested that social psychological mechanisms underlying conflicts are important interactional processes that may hold the clues to understanding this association.</li>
      <li><em>What motivates bystanders to take sides when conflicts erupt?</em> Rogers, Berg, and colleagues at Penn State explored the processes that predict partisanship during disputes. Specifically, they examined how the gender of the people involved in disputes may motivate or deter bystander involvement and examined the potential mechanism underlying the gender effect.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A general theme across these studies is the mechanisms that are responsible for conflict escalation.</p>

    <p><a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/corinne-peek-asa" target="_blank">Dr. Corinne Peek-Asa</a> and <a href="http://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/michelle-reyes" target="_blank">Michelle Reyes</a> are conducting an Instrumented Farm Vehicle Roadway Study, examining crashes between farm equipment and other vehicles, and focusing on vehicle interactions that contribute to rear-end and passing crashes. The goal of the study is to implement a farm equipment roadway safety program at the community level.</p> <p>Each year in the Midwest, more than 1,100 crashes between farm equipment and other vehicles are reported. Usually, these crashes are caused by the non-farm vehicle and occupants of the non-farm vehicle are also more likely to be injured. The most common types of crashes with farm equipment involve rear-end collisions, passing, and turning. However, very little is known about the interaction of farm equipment with other vehicles on the roadway. Thus far, intervention programs have focused on policies to increase farm vehicle visibility and “share the road” campaigns.</p>
    <p>Phase 1 of the study is a collaboration with researchers in Electrical Engineering to develop a rear-facing data collection device to be mounted on farm equipment. Triggered to record when the speed of the farm equipment is greater than 15 mph, the device will capture video that will allow us to observe the frequency and characteristics of cars as they approach farm equipment. The device includes a GPS module so we can quantify the equipment’s exposure to the roadway and contains its own power supply. The passive device will not interfere with visibility for any driver. The primary targets are sprayers/applicators and grain carts. A local agricultural business will collect pilot data during Phase 1.</p>
    <p>Phase 2 will use information from the videos to implement a community-wide intervention to increase farm equipment roadway safety. The intervention will aim to draw the attention of the general public to the presence of farm equipment on the roadway.</p>

The database includes policy adoption dates for the 50 states for over 700 policies and was collected with the support of the National Science Foundation.</p>
    <p>The SPID data includes information on the year of adoption for 728 policies in the American states, documenting the year of first adoption of each policy, for each state. Adoption dates range from 1691 to 2017 and includes all fifty states. Policies are adopted by anywhere from 1 to 50 states, with an average of 24 policy adoptions. The data were assembled from a variety of sources, including academic publications and policy advocacy/information groups. Policies were coded according to the Policy Agendas Project major topic code.</p>
    <p>The standalone Dataverse was created for the SPID and related data and studies. Related data or outputs of SPID will be posted on their own study pages and others are encouraged to contribute related materials.</p>

    <p>UI doctoral student <strong>Kayla Faust</strong> is working to change farm injury statistics through the use of a specialized driving simulation.</p>
    <p>Faust began working with the Transportation and Vehicle Safety Policy Research program as an undergraduate, and is now working as a research assistant at the National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS. An impaired-driving study she assisted with sparked her interest in using the simulator in research. Her love of agriculture prompted her to extend the use of the simulator to improve the safety of farm equipment when meeting dangerous and unavoidable circumstances.</p>
    <p>Faust uses the miniSim, a smaller version of the large-scale simulator, with customized controls and simulations to mimic what a farm equipment operator would experience in a real tractor. The simulation puts farmers on rural roads, fields, and driveways, simulating the environment of the cab of a farm vehicle.</p>
    <p>To achieve accurate data, Faust sought out tractor drivers to advise on the accuracy of the simulation. Her goal was to have at least 100 farmers over the age of 65 to participate in the study.</p>

    <p>Maller said this about the event, "It was a great experience presenting our research at the Capitol and sharing the importance of the Equity Implemented Partnership. This opportunity skilled us with how to make an effective academic poster, how to communicate our research, and ways to engage in discussion with policy makers and student researchers. We were encouraged to share the influence research has had on our future goals and advocate the importance of undergraduate research." </p>
    <p>Heiberg added, "Research in the Capitol was a great place to present research for the first time! There were so many accomplished students there to talk with and discuss diverse research topics. The Iowa legislators that we talked to were interested in our evaluation of the ICCSD professional development programs, they asked us a lot of questions and I hope that we showed them that the University of Iowa is a great resource for information on education policies in the future."</p>
